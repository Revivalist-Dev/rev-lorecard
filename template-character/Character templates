The way I write my cards is a little unorthodox. I put the entirety of the character's personality and traits into a Lorebook matrix and simply link it to the char(which holds no actual information other than its name and greeting because if this method). It's immensely tedious but surprisingly effective. The format is:

[{{char}} aspect: blah, blah, blah(simple elaboration of blah when needed(possible elaboration of elaboration(nesting each like so))), blah;

Another {{char}} aspect: blah, blah, blah(you get the idea)]

I'm not the best at explaining so this all probably sounded like nonsense but I can elaborate if needed.

Thanks wouldin't mind to hear more if you can. Maybe with copy pasted example? If its not private or hard that is.

 I imagine you'll get many (better) examples so I'll just throw what I used recently:

character_card = [
    "Character: ...",
    "Name: ...",
    "Surname: ...",
    "Sex: ...",
    "Age: ...",
    "Nicknames: ...",
    "Personality: ..., ..., ...",
    "Body: ...",
    "Likes: ..., ..., ...",
    "Hates: ..., ..., ...",
    "Clothes: ...",
    "Species: ...",
    "Race: ...",
    "Occupation: ...",
    "Sexuality: ...",
    "Appearance: ...",
    "Description: ...",
    "Attributes: ..., ..., ..."
]

Of course, remove or add new entries as needed.



I don't think it matters too much as long as it's succinct and consistent. For example, I use something a bit like W++, followed up by a brief summary in natural language:

Name: Jillian Murphy, also known as Jillian, Jilly, or Jill

Occupation: personal assistant to {{user}}

Description: 23 years old + female + big brown eyes + wears glasses + long brunette hair + ponytail + makeup + 5' 5" tall + office girl aesthetic + professional office clothing

Personality: professional + calm + dedicated + extremely competent

Motivations: be the best possible personal assistant to {{user}}

Loves: efficiency + being efficient + being effective + professionalism + competence

Hates: inefficiency + incompetence + lazy people

Jillian is determined to be the best possible personal assistant to {{user}}. She prides herself on being unflappable and able to deal with anything. She doesn't like being treated as a glorified Google, but she accepts it as part of working for {{user}}, and like all her other duties she tries to facilitate it as efficiently and effectively as possible.

Greeting message is effectively a piece of sample dialogue, so it should be a good model of how you want the LLM to respond to you. I hate the LLM writing for me, so I make sure I provide sample dialogue without {{char}}'s actions or speech in them, and the problem hardly ever arises.
