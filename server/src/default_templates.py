Your primary task is to analyze the provided HTML and identify CSS selectors for three distinct types of links: **Content Links**, **Category Links**, and a **Pagination Link**.

**Definitions:**
1.  **Content Links**: These lead directly to a final, detailed article about a single topic (e.g., a character profile, an item description, a specific location's page).
2.  **Category Links**: These lead to another page that is also a list, index, or sub-category of more links (e.g., a link to "Cities in Skyrim", "Swords", "Characters by Allegiance").
3.  **Pagination Link**: A single link that leads to the next page of the current list (e.g., a "Next" button).

**Project Goal:**
- Purpose: {{project.search_params.purpose}}
- Extraction Notes: {{project.search_params.extraction_notes}}
- Criteria for Content: {{project.search_params.criteria}}

**Rules for Selector Generation:**
1.  **Prioritize Semantics**: Focus on selectors with meaningful class names (`.character-card`, `.location-entry`) or data attributes (`data-id`). Avoid generic selectors like `div > a`.
2.  **Distinguish Link Types**: A selector is for a **Category Link** if its target pages are primarily other lists. A selector is for a **Content Link** if its target pages are detailed articles matching the project's criteria.
3.  **Content Precedence**: If a link could be considered both (e.g., a link to a major city that also has its own page), it should be classified as a **Content Link**. A link should ONLY be a category if it is NOT a content link.
4.  **Be Specific**: Your selectors should be specific enough to avoid capturing navigation menus, sidebars, or footers.
5.  **Return Empty Lists**: If no selectors of a certain type are found (e.g., no sub-categories on the page), you MUST return an empty list for that key.
6.  **Pagination**: The `pagination_selector` should be a single, specific selector for the "next page" element, or `null` if none exists.

- If it **does not meet** the criteria, set `valid` to `false`, provide a 1-2 sentence `reason` for why it was skipped (e.g., "Content is a list, not a detailed article."), and set `entry` to `null`.

**Step 2: Create the Lorebook Entry (only if valid is true)**

lorebook_definition = """### WORLDINFO (LOREBOOK) DEFINITION

A Lorebook is a collection of entries used to provide an AI with consistent, contextual information about a fictional world. Each entry represents a single concept (e.g., a character, location, or item).

**Purpose:** To ensure the AI consistently recalls key details about the world during role-playing or storytelling.

**Standard Entry Structure:**
- `title`: A concise, descriptive title for the entry (e.g., "Aragorn", "The One Ring").
- `keywords`: A list of keywords that cause this entry to be injected into the AI's context. Always includes the name and common aliases. 1-4 strong keywords.
- `content`: A well-written, factual summary of the subject in an encyclopedic, in-universe tone. Be 100-400 words. Use markdown for formatting.

**Example Entry:**
{
  "title": "Dragonstone Citadel",
  "keywords": ["Dragonstone", "Citadel", "Obsidian Fortress"],
  "content": "A volcanic fortress built from black obsidian. It is the ancestral seat of House Targaryen and home to the ancient Order of Flames, who guard the Eternal Fireâ€”a magical flame that grants visions of the future. The citadel is rumored to be cursed, as its rulers rarely live past 40 years."

character_card_definition = """### CHARACTER CARD DEFINITION

When creating a **character card**, you define a structured profile to guide the AI's behavior and ensure consistency in roleplay or storytelling. Below are the common fields and their purposes:

---

### **1. `name`**
**Purpose**:
The character's primary identifier. The AI uses this to reference the character in dialogue and narration.
**Key Tips**:
- Use a memorable name that reflects their role (e.g., "Zara the Shadowblade" implies stealth/combat).
- Avoid overly complex or ambiguous names (e.g., "Xy'lthraa" may confuse the AI).
**Example**:
`"Seraphina Vale"` (Elegant, hints at nobility) vs. `"Rusty"` (Casual, rugged).

---

### **2. `description`**
**Purpose**:
A snapshot of the character's identity, combining **appearance**, **personality**, and **key traits** to guide the AI's "mental image."
**Structure**:
- **Appearance**: Physical traits (e.g., scars, clothing, species).
- **Personality**: Core demeanor (e.g., stoic, playful).
- **Mannerisms**: Unique habits (e.g., "taps fingers when lying").
**Example**:
> *"A hulking orc with moss-green skin and a chipped tusk, wearing a patchwork cloak. Despite his intimidating frame, he speaks softly and collects wildflowers. Secretly fears fire."*
**Tips**:
- Use vivid, concise language.
- Prioritize traits critical to roleplay (e.g., "blind in one eye" affects interactions).

---

### **3. `persona`**
**Purpose**:
Explicitly defines **how the character thinks/behaves**, reducing ambiguity for the AI. This is the core of their personality.
**What to Include**:
- Core traits (e.g., "optimistic", "paranoid").
- Motivations (e.g., "seeks revenge against the crown").
- Flaws (e.g., "impulsive", "overly trusting").
**Example**:
`"Charismatic but manipulative; values loyalty only when it benefits him. Haunted by guilt over a failed rescue mission."`
**Tips**:
- Use bullet points or short phrases for clarity.
- Avoid contradictions (e.g., "shy" vs. "loves public speaking").

---

### **4. `scenario`**
**Purpose**:
Sets the stage for the interaction, providing **contextual boundaries** for the AI.
**What to Include**:
- **Location**: Where the scene takes place (e.g., "a smoky tavern").
- **Time**: Era or time-sensitive context (e.g., "during a solar eclipse").
- **Relationship**: Predefined ties to the user (e.g., "childhood rivals reunited").
**Example**:
`"A cyberpunk night market in 2147. {{char}} is a rogue hacker who suspects {{user}} works for the corrupt government."`
**Tips**:
- Use dynamic placeholders like `{{user}}` to personalize the scenario.

---

### **5. `first_message`**
**Purpose**:
The character's **opening line**, critical for establishing tone, voice, and narrative momentum.
**Key Elements**:
- **Dialogue**: Shows speech style (formal, slang-heavy).
- **Actions**: Subtle body language (e.g., "crosses arms skeptically").
- **Hook**: Encourages user engagement (e.g., a question or mystery).
**Example**:
`*{{char}} adjusts her gas mask, voice muffled.* "You're the third outsider this week. What makes you think you'll survive the Wastes?"`
**Tips**:
- Avoid passive openings (e.g., "Hello, how can I help you?").
- Mirror the character's personality (e.g., a shy character might stammer).

---

### **6. `example_messages`**
**Purpose**:
Teaches the AI the character's **speech patterns**, **formatting preferences**, and **interaction style**.
**Structure**:
- Use `{{char}}` and `{{user}}` placeholders.
- Mix dialogue and actions (e.g., `*{{char}} smirks.* "You're bold. I like that."`).
- Show range (e.g., anger, sarcasm, vulnerability).
**Example**:
```
{{user}}: Why should I trust you?
{{char}}: *Pulls a dagger from her boot and twirls it.* "You shouldn't. But I'm your only way out of this alive."
```
**Tips**:
- Include 3â€“5 varied exchanges.
- Match the character's voice (e.g., a poet might use metaphors).

---

### **7. Advanced Tips**
- **Avoid "Wall of Text"**: Use line breaks and punctuation to improve readability for the AI.
- **Writing Style**: Third-person, roleplaying.
